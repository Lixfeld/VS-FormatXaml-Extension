This extension is inspired by [XamlFormatter][1] from DannOh which I used for Visual Studio 2017 and 2019.

## Format XAML

Unlike [XAML Styler][2] this extension formats XAML documents line by line without encoding to preserve the original string. This means that the formatter only indents the lines without reordering elements inline or between lines.  

### Options
In the new category "Format XAML" you can disable the formatting on save and change other settings.  

### Keyboard shortcut
You can add a shortcut to the command in the Tools menu.  
Options -> Environment -> Keyboard -> Tools.FormatXAML
